<li>NOTE:
Should we have a general email (like support) that we send everything to? Everyone will have access to it but it will help if we get a sudden burst of emails as to not clog everyone’s emails. Plus we will know if someone replied already that way.
We need to clean up our email system, make new ones, modify current ones, etc.
